## Getting started

To run **regenie**, use the command `./regenie` on the command line,
followed by options and flags as needed.

To get a full list of options use

```
./regenie --help
```

The directory `examples/` contains some small example files that are
useful when getting started. A test run on a set of binary traits can be achieved by the
following 2 commands.

In **Step 1**, the whole genome regression model is fit to the traits, and
a set of genomic predictions are produced as output

```
./regenie \
  --step 1 \
  --bed example/example \
  --exclude example/snplist_rm.txt \
  --covarFile example/covariates.txt \
  --phenoFile example/phenotype_bin.txt \
  --remove example/fid_iid_to_remove.txt \
  --bsize 100 \
  --bt --lowmem \
  --lowmem-prefix tmp_rg \
  --out fit_bin_out
```

In **Step 2**, a set of imputed SNPs are tested for association using a
Firth logistic regression model

```
./regenie \
  --step 2 \
  --bgen example/example.bgen \
  --covarFile example/covariates.txt \
  --phenoFile example/phenotype_bin.txt \
  --remove example/fid_iid_to_remove.txt \
  --bsize 200 \
  --bt \
  --firth --approx \
  --pThresh 0.01 \
  --pred fit_bin_out_pred.list \
  --out test_bin_out_firth
```

One of the output files from these two commands is included in the `example/` directory and 
you can check they are the same using  the following command (the message should be printed out)

```
cmp test_bin_out_firth_Y1.regenie example/example.test_bin_out_firth_Y1.regenie \
  && echo "Files are identical"
```

#### Genetic data file format

**regenie** can read BGEN files, bed/bim/fam files or pgen/psam/pvar 
files in Step 1 and Step 2.

The BGEN file format is described
[here](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/).

The bed/bim/fam file format is described [here](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats).

The pgen/pvar/psam file format is described [here](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/formats#pgen).

Tools useful for genetic data file format conversion are : [PLINK](http://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/), [QCTOOL](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/qctool/), [BCFTOOLS](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/).

Step 2 of **regenie** can be sped up with BGEN files by using v1.2 format with 8 bits encoding 
(genotype file can be generated with [PLINK2](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/) using 
option `--export bgen-1.2 'bits=8'`) as well as having an accompanying .bgi index file 
(a useful tool to create such file is bgenix which is part of the BGEN library).

To include X chromosome genotypes in step 1 and/or step 2, males should be coded as diploid 
so that their genotypes are 0/2. This can be done in PLINK by setting the sex of all 
individuals to female before generating the genotype file.
Chromosome values of 23 (for human analyses), X, XY, PAR1 and PAR2 are all acceptable and 
will be collapsed into a single chromosome.


##### Sample inclusion/exclusion file format

```
2 2 
7 7 
.
```

No header. Each line starts with individual FID IID. Space/tab separated.

Samples listed in the file that are not in bgen/bed/pgen file are ignored.

##### Variant inclusion/exclusion file format

```
20
31
.
```

No header. Each line must start with variant ID 
(if there are additional columns, file must be space/tab separated).

Variants listed in this file that are not in bgen/bed/pgen file are ignored.

#### Covariate file format

```
FID IID V1 V2 V3
1 1 1.46837294454993 1.93779743016325 0.152887004505393
2 2 -1.2234390803815 -1.63408619199948 -0.190201446835255
3 3 0.0711531925667286 0.0863906292357564 0.14254739715665
.
```

Line 1 : Header with FID, IID and \(C\) covariate names.

Followed by lines of \(C+2\) values. Space/tab separated.

Each line contains individual FID and IID followed by \(C\) covariate
values.

Samples listed in this file that are not in bgen/bed/pgen file are ignored.
Genotyped samples that are not in this file are removed from the analysis.

No missing values are allowed.

If `--step 2` is specified, then the covariate file should be the same
as that used in Step 1.

#### Phenotype file format

```
FID IID Y1 Y2
1 1 1.64818554321186 2.2765234736685
2 2 -2.67352013711554 -1.53680421614647
3 3 0.217542851471485 0.437289912695016
.
```

Line 1 : Header with FID, IID and \(P\) phenotypes names.

Followed by lines of \(P+2\) values. Space/tab separated. 
Each line contains individual FID and IID followed by P phenotype values
(for binary traits, must be coded as 0=control, 1=case, NA=missing unless using `--1`).

Samples listed in this file that are not in bgen/bed/pgen file are ignored.
Genotyped samples that are not in this file are removed from the analysis.

Missing values must be coded as NA.

With QTs, missing values are mean-imputed in Step 1 and they are dropped when testing each phenotype in Step 2 (unless using `--force-impute`).

With BTs, missing values are mean-imputed in Step 1 when fitting the
level 0 linear ridge regression and 
they are dropped when fitting the level 1 logistic ridge regression for each trait . 
In Step 2, missing values are dropped when testing each trait.

To remove all samples that have missing values at **any** of the \(P\) phenotypes, use option `--strict` in Step 1 and 2.

#### Predictions file format

Running `--step 1 --out foo` will produce

1. A set of files containing genomic predictions for each phenotype
   from Step 1 (see Output section below).
2. A file called `foo_pred.list` listing the locations of the prediction files.

The file list is needed as an input file when using `--step 2`
via the `--pred` option. 
It has one line per phenotype (in any order) that specifies the name of the phenotype and its
corresponding prediction file name. 
Each phenotype must have exactly one prediction file and phenotype names 
must match with those in the phenotype file.
Phenotypes in this file not included in the analysis are ignored.

Each prediction file contains the genetic predictions for the phenotype (space separated).

Line 1 starts with 'FID_IID' followed by $N$ sample identifiers.
It is followed by 23 lines containing the genetic predictions for each chromosome 
(sex chromosomes are collapsed into chromosome 23).

More specifically, each line has $N+1$ values which are the chromosome number followed by the $N$
leave-one chromosome out (LOCO) predictions for each individual.

Samples in this file not in the bed/pgen/bgen input file are ignored. Genotyped samples not 
present in this file will be ignored in the analysis of the corresponding trait. 

Samples with missing LOCO predictions must have their corresponding phenotype value set to missing.

When step 1 of **regenie** is run in low memory mode (i.e. using `--lowmem`), 
temporary files are created on disk (using `--lowmem-prefix tmp_prefix` determines 
where the files are written [as in `tmp_prefix_l0_Y1`,...,`tmp_prefix_l0_YP` 
for P phenotypes]). If the prefix is not specified, the default is to use the 
prefix specified by `--out` (see below).
These are automatically deleted at the end of the program (unless the run
was not successful in which case the user would need to delete the files)

See the [Wiki page](https://github.com/rgcgithub/regenie/wiki/Further-parallelization-for-level-0-models-in-Step-1) for more details on how to run the level 0 models for Step 1 
of **regenie** in parallel.


### Output

| Option | Argument | Type | Description|
|---|-------|------|----|
|`--out`| FILE PREFIX| Required| Output files that depends on `--step`|

A log file `file.log` of the output is generated.

**Using `--step 1 --out file`**

For the \(P\) phenotypes, files `file_1.loco`,...,`file_P.loco` are output with the
per-chromosome LOCO predictions as rows of the files. 
If option `--gz` was used, the files will be compressed in gzip format and have extension `.loco.gz`.

Genotyped individuals specified using option `--remove` are excluded from this file. 
Individuals with missing phenotype values kept in the analysis 
are included in the file and have their predictions set to missing.

The list of blup files needed for step 2 (association testing) is written to  `file_pred.list`.

If using `--print-prs`, files `files_1.prs`,...,`files_P.prs` will be written with the 
whole genome predictions (i.e. PRS) without using LOCO scheme (similar format as the .loco files).
The list of these files is written to `file_prs.list` and can be used in step 2 with `--pred` and 
specifying flag `--use-prs`. Note that as these are not obtained using a LOCO scheme, 
association tests could suffer from proximal contamination.

**Using`--step 2 --out file`** 

By default, results are written in separate files for
each phenotype
`file_<phenotype1_name>.regenie,...,file_<phenotypeP_name>.regenie`.
Each file has one line per
SNP along with a header line.
If option `--gz` was used, the files will be compressed in gzip format and have extension `.regenie.gz`.

The entries of each row specify chromosome, posistion, ID, reference allele (allele 0), 
alternative allele (allele 1), frequency of the alternative allele, sample size and the test performed 
(additive/dominant/recessive).
With BGEN/PGEN files with dosages, the imputation INFO score is provided 
(IMPUTE info score for BGEN and Mach Rsq for PGEN).
Allele frequency, sample size and INFO score, if applicable, are computed using only
non-missing samples for each phenotype.

These are followed by the estimated effect sizes (on original scale), standard errors, chi-square test statistics 
and \(-\log_{10}\) p-value.

If option `--write-samples` was used, IDs of samples used for each trait will be written in files
`file_<phenotype1_name>.regenie.ids,...,file_<phenotypeP_name>.regenie.ids` (tab separated, no header).



## Burden testing

Starting from version 2.0, Step 2 of **regenie** now provides burden testing functionality.
More specifically, a user can combine genetic variants within a gene (or region), using functional annotations, into a single combined 'mask' genotype, that can be tested for association using the [same testing options](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/options/#options) as with single variants. 

### Input

| Option | Argument | Type | Description|
|---|-------|------|----|
|`--anno-file`  | FILE | Required | File with variant annotations for each set|
|`--set-list`  | FILE | Required | File listing variant sets|
|`--extract-sets`  | FILE | Optional | Inclusion file that lists IDs of variant sets to keep|
|`--exclude-sets`  | FILE | Optional | Exclusion file that lists IDs of variant sets to remove|
|`--extract-setlist`  | STRING | Optional | Comma-separated list of variant sets to keep|
|`--exclude-setlist`  | STRING | Optional | Comma-separated list of variant sets to remove|
|`--aaf-file`  | FILE | Optional | File with variant AAF to use when building masks (instead of AAF estimated from sample)|
|`--mask-def`  | FILE | Required | File with mask definitions using the annotations defined in `--anno-labels`|

#### Annotation input files

The following files are used to define variant sets and 
functional annotations which will be used to generate masks.

##### Annotation file

```bash
1:55039839:T:C PCSK9 LoF
1:55039842:G:A PCSK9 missense
.
```
This file defines functional annotations for variants.
It is designed to accommodate for variants with 
separate annotations for different sets/genes.

Each line contains the variant name, the set/gene name and a single annotation category 
(space/tab separated). 

Variants not in this file will be assigned to a default "NULL" category. A maximum of 63 annotation 
categories (+NULL category) is allowed.

For gene sets, tools you can use to obtain variant annotations per transcripts are 
[snpEFF](https://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/se_introduction/) or 
[VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html).
To obtain a single annotation per gene, you could choose the most deleterious
functional annotation across the gene transcripts or alternatively
use the canonical transcript (note that its definition can vary across software).

We have implemented an extended 4-column format of the annotation file which
also categorizes sets into domains (e.g. for gene sets, these would correspond to gene domains).

```bash
1:55039839:T:C PCSK9 Prodomain LoF
1:55039842:G:A PCSK9 Prodomain missense
.
```
Masks will be generated for each domain 
(maximum of 8 per set/gene) in addition 
to a mask combining across all domains.
Variants can only be assigned to a single domain for each set/gene.


##### Set list file

This file lists variants within each set/gene to use when 
building masks. 
Each line contains the set/gene name followed by a chromosome and physical position for the set/gene,
then by a comma-separated list of variants included in the set/gene.

```bash
A1BG 19  58346922  19:58346922:C:A,19:58346924:G:A,...
A1CF 10  50806630  10:50806630:A:G,10:50806630:A:AT,...
.
```

Variants in the same set must belong to the chromosome specified in the 2nd column.

##### Set inclusion/exclusion file format
The file must have a single column of set/gene names corresponding to those in the 
set list file.

```bash
PIGP
ZBTB38
.
```


##### AAF file (optional)

Both functional annotations and alternative allele frequency (AAF) cutoffs 
are used when building masks (e.g. only considering LoF
sites where AAF is below 1%). 
By default, the AAF for each variant is computed from the sample but
alternatively, the user can specify variant AAFs using this file.

Each line contains the variant name followed by its AAF 
(it should correspond to ALT allele used in the genetic data input). 

```bash
7:6187101:C:T 1.53918207864341e-05
7:6190395:C:A 2.19920388819247e-06
.
```


#### Mask definitions

##### Mask file
This file specifies which annotation categories should be combined into masks. 
Each line contains a mask name followed by a comma-seperated list 
of categories included in the mask (i.e. union is taken over categories).

For example below, Mask1 uses only LoF variants and 
Mask2 uses LoF and missense annotated variants.


```bash
Mask1 LoF
Mask2 LoF,missense
.
```

##### AAF cutoffs
Option `--aaf-bins` specifies the AAF upper bounds used to generate masks.
By default, a mask based on singleton sites are always included.

For example, `--aaf-bins 0.01,0.05` will generate 3 masks for AAFs in 
[0,0.01], [0,0.05] and singletons.

#### LOVO scheme

The leave-one-variant-out (LOVO) scheme takes all sites goint into a mask,
and builds LOVO masks 
by leaving out one variant at a time from the full set of sites. 
The mask including all sites will also be computed.

The argument for `--mask-lovo` is a comma-separated list which 
consists of 
the set/gene name, 
the mask name, 
and the AAF cutoff (either 'singleton' or a double in (0,1)).

If using a 4-column annotation file, then `--mask-lovo` should have 
the set name, 
the domain name,
the mask name, 
and the AAF cutoff.


#### Writing mask files 
Masks built in **regenie** can be written to PLINK bed format. 
If the input genetic data contains dosages, 
the masks dosages will be converted to hard-calls prior to being written to file 
and these hard-calls will be used for the association testing.

The PLINK bed file is written using 'ref-last' encoding (i.e. REF allele is 
listed last in the bim file).

Note that this cannot be used with the LOVO scheme.

### Options
| Option | Argument | Type | Description|
|---|-------|------|----|
|`--aaf-bins`| FLOAT,...,FLOAT| Optional| comma-separated list of AAF upper bounds to use when building masks [default is a single cutoff of 1%]|
|`--build-mask`| STRING| Optional| build masks using the maximum number of ALT alleles across sites (`'max'`; the default), or the sum of ALT alleles (`'sum'`), or thresholding the sum to 2 (`'comphet'`)|
|`--singleton-carrier`| FLAG| Optional| to define singletons as variants with a single carrier in the sample (rather than alternative allele count=1)|
|`--write-mask`| FLAG| Optional| write mask to PLINK bed format **(does not work when building masks with 'sum')**|
|`--skip-test`| FLAG| Optional| to skip computing association tests after building masks and writing them to file|
|`--mask-lovo`| STRING| Optional| to perform LOVO scheme|
|`--check-burden-files`| FLAG| Optional| to check the concordance between annotation, set list and mask files [see [below](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/options/#checking-input-files)]|
|`--strict-check-burden`| FLAG| Optional|to exit early if the annotation, set list and mask definition files dont agree [see [below](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/options/#checking-input-files)]|

Three rules can be used to build masks with `--build-mask` as shown in diagram below, 
where the last rule `comphet` applies a threshold of 2 to the mask from the `sum` rule.

![MaskRules](img/mask_rules.png){ style="text-align:center;padding: 10px;width:60%;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"}

### Output
**With `--out file`**

Results are written in separate files for each phenotype
`file_<phenotype1_name>.regenie,...,file_<phenotypeP_name>.regenie` 
with the same output format mentioned [above](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/options/#output).
Additionally, a header line is included (starting with `##`)
which contains mask definition information.

Masks will have name `<set_name>.<mask_name>.<AAF_cutoff>` with the 
chromosome and physical position having been defined in the set list file, 
and the reference allele being `ref`, and the alternate allele corresponding to 
`<mask_name>.<AAF_cutoff>`.
When using `--mask-lovo`, the mask name will be the same as above but have suffix
`_<variant_name>` to specify the variant which was excluded when building the mask.

With `--build-mask sum`, the reported mask AAF corresponds to the average 
AAF across sites included in the mask.

If using `--write-mask`, the masks will be saved to 
`file_masks.{bed,bim,fam}`. 

<!---
|`--write-setlist`| FILE| Optional| to create set list files from built-in masks (use with `--write-mask`; see format below)|
With `--write-setlist`, new set list files will be written which contain list of sets
based on the written masks. 
The option takes in a file with 2 columns containing 
a file suffix for the new set list file, as well as a list of the masks
which will constitute the sets (set names/chr/pos are obtained from the input set list file).

```bash
onlyLoFs Mask1
LoFs+Splice Mask1,Mask3
```
This creates two set list files, one called `file_onlyLoFs.setlist` with sets consisting of  
Mask1 masks (across all AAF cutoffs) 
and another one called `file_LoFs+Splice.setlist` 
with sets consisting of Mask1 and Mask3 masks.
-->

### Example run
Using Step 1 results from the [Step 1 command above](https://rgcgithub.github.io/regenie/options/#getting-started), we use the following command to build and test masks in Step 2
```
./regenie \
  --step 2 \
  --bed example/example_3chr \
  --covarFile example/covariates.txt \
  --phenoFile example/phenotype_bin.txt \
  --bt \
  --remove example/fid_iid_to_remove.txt \
  --firth --approx \
  --pred fit_bin_out_pred.list \
  --anno-file example/example_3chr.annotations \
  --set-list example/example_3chr.setlist \
  --mask-def example/example_3chr.masks \
  --aaf-bins 0.1,0.05 \
  --write-mask \
  --bsize 200 \
  --out test_bin_out_firth
```

For each set, this will produce masks using 3 AAF cutoffs (singletons, 5% and 10% AAF). 
The masks are written to PLINK bed file (in `test_bin_out_firth_masks.{bed,bim,fam}`) 
and tested for association with each binary trait using Firth approximate test 
(summary stats in `test_bin_out_firth_<phenotype_name>.regenie`). 
Note that the test uses the whole genome regression LOCO PRS from Step 1 of **regenie** (specified by `--pred`).

### Checking input files
To assess the concordance between the input files for building masks, you can use  `--check-burden-files` which will generate a report in `file_masks_report.txt` containing:
 
1. for each set, the list the variants in the set-list file which are unrecognized (not genotyped 
or not present in annotation file for the set)

2. for each mask, the list of annotations in the mask definition file which are not in the annotation file

Additionally, you can use `--strict-check-burden` to
enforce full agreement between the three files 
(if not, program will terminate) :

1. all genotyped variants in the set list file must be in the annotation file (for the corresponding set)

2. all annotations in the mask definition file must be present in the annotation file
